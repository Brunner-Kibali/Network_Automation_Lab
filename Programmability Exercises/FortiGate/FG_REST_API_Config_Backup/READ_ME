Fortigate RestAPI Config Backup – FortiOS 6.0.4

Previously I wrote a post how to backup the Fortigate config using session based authentication.
As per the API reference, this is considered legacy, and other authentication method –API token, is preferred.
In this post, I demonstrate how to use FortiOS RestAPI with API token.
And I will introduce how to parse current configuration.

I used FortiOS 6.0.4 to deploy this, and it is most likely not working with other version(especially 5.x).

The flow is as follows:

1. Create access profile for API user
2. Create API user in Fortigate
3. Generate API token for API user
4. Send request and get the backup config
