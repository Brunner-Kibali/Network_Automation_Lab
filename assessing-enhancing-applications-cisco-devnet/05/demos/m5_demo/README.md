# Module 5 - Operating and Troubleshooting a CI Pipeline
There are no new demo files for this module. Please reference the
module 4 demo files instead. You can hand-edit the `requirements.txt`
file to remove packages or change their versions to simulate various
CI failures. Alternatively, you can modify the source code or test code
to simulate test-related failures
